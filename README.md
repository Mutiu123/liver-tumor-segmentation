## Project Description:
Liver tumor segmentation is a critical task in medical imaging. Accurate delineation of tumor regions within liver CT or MRI scans is essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring disease progression. Traditional manual segmentation by radiologists is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. The goal is to develop an automated deep learning model that can precisely segment liver tumors, improving clinical workflows and patient outcomes.
This project propose a deep neural network for liver tumor segmentation using the U-Net architecture and PyTorch. U-Net is well-suited for medical image segmentation due to its ability to capture fine details while maintaining contextual information. The focus of this project is accurate tumor delineation within liver CT or MRI scans, leveraging 3D slices. Specifically, It was ensured that each patientâ€™s data consists of 64 contiguous slices, providing richer spatial information for tumor segmentation.

## Methodology:
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset was obtained from [MONAI:](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HqEgzS8BV2c7xYNrZdEAnrHk7osJJ--2).
   - Preprocess images (normalize intensity, resize) and create training, validation, and test sets.
   **Data Preparation**:
   **3D Slice Extraction:
   - For each patient, 64 contiguous slices was extracted from the volumetric CT or MRI scans to maintain uniform data size.
   - These slices capture the entire liver region and allow the model to learn spatial dependencies across multiple slices.
2. **Data Cleaning:
   - Handling Missing Data:
      Identify and handle missing values in the dataset.
      For instance, if any patient scans lacked tumor annotations, I imputed or excluded those samples appropriately.
   **Noise Reduction:
      Remove noise from the images caused by artifacts, motion, or other factors.
      Techniques include median filtering, Gaussian blurring, or denoising autoencoders.
   **Outlier Detection and Removal:
     Detect and address outliers in pixel intensity values. Outliers can adversely affect model training and segmentation accuracy.
   **Normalization and Standardization:
     Normalize pixel intensities to a consistent range [0, 1].
     Standardize features to have zero mean and unit variance.
   **Class Imbalance Handling:
     Address the imbalance between tumor and non-tumor pixels.
     Use weighted loss functions during training.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Initialize U-Net architecture with pretrained weights (if available).
   - Train the model using liver tumor images and corresponding masks.
   - Optimize hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size) via cross-validation.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model on the test set using metrics like Dice coefficient.
   - Visualize predicted tumor masks for qualitative assessment.

4. **Clinical Impact Achieved**:
   - Reduced manual segmentation time.
   - Improved consistency and accuracy in tumor delineation.
   - Enhanced patient care and treatment planning.


## Applications:
1. **Clinical Decision Support**:
   - The model can assists radiologists by providing accurate tumor segmentations.
   - It can aids in treatment planning (surgery, radiation therapy) and assessing treatment response.

2. **Quantitative Analysis**:
   - Quantify tumor volume and growth over time.
   - Monitor treatment efficacy and predict patient outcomes.

3. **Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD)**:
   - Integrate the model into existing CAD systems.
   - Enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce human error.


## Future Directions:
1. **Multi-Modal Fusion**:
   - Explore combining CT and MRI data for robust tumor segmentation.
   - Extend the model to segment other abdominal organs (e.g., kidneys, spleen).
   - A holistic approach benefits comprehensive diagnosis.

2. **Fine-Tuning and Hyperparameter Optimization**:
   - Continuously fine-tune the model using additional annotated data.
   - Explore hyperparameter tuning to further boost performance.

3. **Interpretable Segmentation Maps**:
   - Investigate techniques for generating interpretable tumor masks.
   - Explainable AI can build trust among medical professionals.

4. **Multi-Organ Segmentation**:
